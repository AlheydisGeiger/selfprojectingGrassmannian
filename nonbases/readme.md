This directory contains the nonbases for all selfprojecting matroids considered in "The self-projecting Grassmannian".
For rank 3 and bigger the matroids are simple. The matroids defined by the nonbases in the files "nonbaseskn" are all framed. The unframed matroids (only applicable for (4,8), (4,9) and (5,10) ) are in extra files.
