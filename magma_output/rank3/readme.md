Summary: For n = 6,7 all computations terminated quickly. No need for the optimized code. For n=8, there were 5 matroids which did not terminate within 360s, 2 of them terminated later, the remaining 3 are still running. The data of these last 5 matroids is not yet accessible, since the files are still in use. opt_3_8_onlyR contains the computations of only R with template for the creation of the .mrdi files
